D. Methodology

The research methodology follows a structured, nine-stage computational pipeline designed for reproducibility and robustness. Each stage is an independent component that feeds into the next, ensuring a clear and traceable workflow from data acquisition to final model evaluation.

**Stage 1: Data Acquisition**
The foundational stage involves the programmatic collection of artifact images. A custom data acquisition component queries the Wikimedia Commons API, starting from a seed category (e.g., "Category:Ancient_Greek_pottery_in_the_Louvre") and recursively traversing its subcategories to gather relevant image URLs. This process is subject to a configurable download limit to manage dataset size, resulting in a local collection of raw image files.

**Stage 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Once the raw data is acquired, a comprehensive EDA is performed. This stage automatically analyzes the image collection to extract key metadata, such as image dimensions, file formats, and color modes. The output of this stage provides a clear statistical and visual overview of the dataset's characteristics (e.g., the generation of `summary_statistics.txt` and plots like `file_format_distribution.png`), which is crucial for informing the subsequent processing steps.

**Stage 3: Data Processing**
To ensure consistency for the deep learning model, all raw images undergo a standardization process. Each image is resized to a uniform resolution of 512x512 pixels and converted to the PNG format. This step eliminates variability in input data and prevents potential errors during model training (e.g., processing `855 Jarra Ã¡tica (51311273086).jpg` into a standardized PNG file).

**Stage 4: Data Splitting**
The curated and processed dataset is partitioned into three distinct subsets to ensure unbiased evaluation of the model. The data is divided into a training set (70%), a validation set (15%), and a final holdout test set (15%). This strict separation is critical for training the model, tuning its parameters, and assessing its generalization performance on unseen data.

**Stage 5: Feature Engineering (Masking)**
To simulate the artifact restoration task for the inpainting model, artificial damage is introduced into the images. For each image in the training, validation, and test sets, a corresponding mask is generated. This is achieved by creating random rectangular masks that obscure a portion of the image, thereby creating the `(image, mask)` pairs required for training the model to reconstruct the missing regions.

**Stage 6: Hyperparameter Tuning**
The selection of optimal model hyperparameters is a critical step for achieving peak performance. While this pipeline stage is designed to integrate with automated tuning libraries (e.g., Optuna, Ray Tune) to systematically search for the best combination of learning rate, batch size, and other parameters, the initial MVP run utilizes a set of predefined, validated hyperparameters to ensure a complete and rapid pipeline execution for baseline modeling.

**Stage 7: Model Training**
This stage involves fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model for the specific task of artifact inpainting. The core model, sourced from the Hugging Face model hub (e.g., `runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting`), is trained on the masked image dataset. The model learns to predict and reconstruct the missing pixels within the masked regions by leveraging the visual context of the surrounding, undamaged portions of the artifact.

**Stage 8: Model Evaluation**
The performance of the fine-tuned model is rigorously assessed using the unseen test set. The evaluation is both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative analysis involves calculating objective metrics such as the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to measure the pixel-level accuracy of the reconstructions. Qualitatively, the restored images are visually compared against their original, ground-truth counterparts to assess the perceptual quality and semantic correctness of the inpainting.

**Stage 9: Deployment Preparation**
The final stage of the pipeline involves packaging all necessary components for deployment or further use. This includes the fine-tuned model weights, the final hyperparameters file, and a README document. This creates a self-contained, portable package that allows the trained model to be easily shared, tested, or integrated into other applications.
