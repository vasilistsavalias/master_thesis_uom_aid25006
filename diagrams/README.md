# Diagrams

This directory is for storing all architectural and conceptual diagrams related to the project.

## Subdirectories
- `src/`: Contains the editable source files for the diagrams (e.g., Mermaid `.mmd` files, `draw.io` files, etc.). This allows for easy updates and version control of the diagrams themselves.
- `output/`: Contains the exported, viewable versions of the diagrams (e.g., `.png`, `.svg`). These are the files that should be embedded in documentation or the final thesis.
