The harp was identified by musicologist Carl Engel as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonon\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Trigonon\">Trigonon</a> in his book \"Musical Instruments.\"\n</p><p>Text accompanying image from the book:\n</p>\n<pre>Fig. 6.\u2014A Muse with a Harp, and two others with Lyres.\n</pre>\nFrom a Greek vase in the Munich Museum.  The design on the Greek vase at Munich (already alluded to) represents the nine Muses, of whom three are given in the engraving (Fig. 6), viz., one with the harp, and two others with lyres. Some of the lyres were provided with a bridge, while others were without it. The largest was held probably on or between the knees, or were attached to the left arm by means of a band, to enable the performer to use his hands 30without impediment. The strings, made of catgut or sinew, were more usually twanged with a plektron than merely with the fingers. The plektron was a short stem of ivory or metal pointed at both ends.",
